                Farah Soobhan, founder of Farah Visual Arts is a teacher and contemporary
                mixed- media artist who uses the recognisable and versatile style of pop art to
                explore her own identity as a Muslim woman living in the West. Her work
                highlights deeper messages relating to political and humanitarian crisis taking
                place globally.
                </p>
                <p>
                The bright and bold aesthetics of her paintings juxtaposes the serious concepts
                she wants to relay to her audience. Farah uses her art to express her thoughts
                and feelings on so many causes ranging from religion, terrorism, police brutality
                and the refugee crisis to misogyny, Islamophobia and mental health.
                </p>
                <p>

                She is on a personal journey to evolve as a creative by continuously developing
                her artistic style and application techniques further in order to always connect
                and engage fully through her works. She is always aiming to visually challenge
                the norms of traditional Islamic art as well as seeking new themes to explore
                such as her own British, Mauritian and South African heritage, culture and
                personal experiences.
                </p>
